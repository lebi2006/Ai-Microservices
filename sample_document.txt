FastAPI is a modern web framework for building APIs in Python 3.7+. It is fast, supports async operations, and generates interactive API documentation automatically.
LangChain is an open-source framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by large language models (LLMs). Instead of working with raw models directly, LangChain provides modular components for chaining prompts, connecting with external data sources (like PDFs, databases, or APIs), and orchestrating reasoning workflows. It supports use cases such as question answering over documents, conversational agents, summarization, and more. By offering integrations with multiple LLMs, vector databases, and tools, LangChain enables developers to build production-ready AI systems that are dynamic, context-aware, and scalable.
